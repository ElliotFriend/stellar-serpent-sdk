# serpent — Decision Log

Judgment calls made autonomously during M1 execution, recorded for review and
reversal. Each entry: context, decision, why, and reversal cost. Fine-grained
task rulings live in the per-plan SDD ledgers during execution; entries here are
the ones with lasting consequence. (Decisions made *with* Elliot in-session are
in the spec/findings docs, not here.)

## 2026-08-26 Standing-autonomy mechanics for M1
- Context: Elliot granted continue-through-M1 autonomy with a reviewable
  decision record ("keep chugging... clearly see where those decisions were
  made so we can reverse/change them").
- Decision: This log is that record. Sub-plans B–G are authored, adversarially
  reviewed, triaged, executed, and locally merged to main without per-phase
  sign-off; every judgment call lands here in the same commit series as the
  work. Hard stops remain: irreversible/outward actions and the spec-mandated
  user-approved testnet deployment at M1's end.
- Why: Matches the granted balance of momentum vs. auditability.
- Reversal cost: None — process-level; revoke anytime.

## 2026-08-26 M1-A review adoptions that shape user-facing surface
- Context: M1-A adversarial review; all findings adopted (triage presented
  in-session). Three shape the authoring surface beyond the session summary:
  `errorcode(N)` declarations, `Bytes32`/`Bytes64` aliases (both spec-corrected,
  flagged to Elliot), and `Vec(U32)`/`Map(Symbol, U32)` explicit element types
  at construction with `Vec[U32]`/`Map[K, V]` as annotation-only forms.
- Decision: as stated; also reflected ops supported so `sum()` works over chain
  ints, and `**`/`divmod`/bitwise are explicit TypeErrors until a contract
  needs them; U256/I256 deferred to M2.
- Why: Each verified against mypy repros / runtime-generics limits; details in
  the M1-A plan's Global Constraints and the review transcript summary.
- Reversal cost: Low before sub-plan C consumes the surfaces; moderate after
  (compiler frontend patterns would need updating).
